This is a special version version of the IRremote library for Arduino which focusses on sending and receiving data to and from infrared "laser tag" style toys.

This is library based on the IRremote library from Ken Shirriff. You can download the original source code from github (http://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote).

For details on the original library see the Wiki on github or the blog post http://arcfn.com/2009/08/multi-protocol-infrared-remote-library.html

The library was inspired by http://www.meatandnetworking.com/projects/hacking-at-the-light-strike-laser-tag-game/ .
